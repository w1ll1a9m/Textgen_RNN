 But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead. I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers  instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones. At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college. My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities. My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year. By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities. Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world  that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America. The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children. All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have  or how many journalists they know  not how many Americans they help to live better lives. But the failures of the past are about to end. Those failures end beginning on November 8th. We will have One American Nation. We will be One American People. We are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace. That means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job. This is how we will rebuild our future. This is how We Will Make America Great Again  For Everyone. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. [laughter]  In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership. [applause] And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! MR. TRUMP: Thank you. [applause] Amazing, amazing group. One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you. [applause] All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals. [cheers and applause] I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. [applause]  True. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana. [cheers and applause] And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. [cheers and applause]  Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right! MR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it? [laughter] Yeah, it is right. [applause] Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation. [cheers and applause] So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. [laughter and jeers] So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before. [cheers and applause] Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty  remember, remember. [cheers and applause] I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great  that was an amazing experience. [applause] And the bishop, what a great guy.  In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church  and this is all across the country  for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience. [applause] This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives  all of us. [cheers and applause] Our nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. [cheers and applause] Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things  and these are great things  that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody. The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away. [cheers and applause] The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status. All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings  [cheers and applause]  on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment  [cheers and applause]  if I am elected your president, I promise. [cheers and applause] So important. Thank you. That's so important. And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest. And I said to them  we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue  and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated. [laughter] And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty. I said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems  powerful guy. I actually, as just own way  you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly  he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status. So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well  and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just  and magnificent hearts, much more importantly  they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express. And that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. [cheers and applause] When you  when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men  let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship  like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right? [cheers and applause] I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of  we're going to get rid of it so fast. And I'm so proud to say  honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud  I was just telling this to Tony  to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very  [laughter]  the only way. [applause] So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important. I hope  which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot  you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote. AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did. MR. TRUMP: You did? Well, you did. A few of you did. [laughter] Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have  and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up  your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th. [cheers and applause] Thank you. [cheers and applause] And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th. We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  [cheers and applause]  which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period  very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives  much better health care at a much lower price. [cheers and applause] Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been. One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice. [cheers and applause] And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community  none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years  over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime. When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing  jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. [cheers and applause] I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time  the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. [applause] And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents  and I say it with great respect  our inner cities are a disaster  crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety. [applause] You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. [cheers and applause] School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition  the schools the schools will get better and better and better. [cheers and applause] And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. [cheers and applause] Hundred percent. Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe. My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children  [applause]  including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. [cheers and applause]  This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs. [applause] However  that's good, right? [applause] However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. [applause]  If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice.  My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city  anybody  anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program  and there will be a lot of them  to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student.  As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core  we're going to end it. [cheers and applause] We're bringing education local.  I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised  remember this, November 8th  don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? [cheers and applause]  They're starting  people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have  what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same  rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50  it's not going to change. Not going to happen.  Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court. [cheers and applause] Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be  I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.  One of the most important issues, frankly  other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted. [cheers and applause] We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important  some people think it's actually the most important  is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what  how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? [cheers and applause] This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written. [cheers and applause] We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up.  Let's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well. [laughter] Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty  not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably  as you know it  you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that. Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test  its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support. But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account. [laughter] All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors  27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie. And I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash  cash. And I actually said  they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror. Think of it  $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash  massive, big vats of cash. You saw them  cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash. [laughter] Hey, never saw anything like this  $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get  they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do  even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this  just another lie. But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid. [laughter] They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long. [cheers and applause] Very sad. [cheers and applause] At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue  can 't let it. [cheers and applause] ISIS must be destroyed  have to; have no choice. To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago  different world. We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism  [cheers and applause]  words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism. By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians  very, very, very rare. So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it. You ever notice on the  you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that  scenes far worse than that. So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. [applause] Now she wants to get rid of  oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you  [laughter]  they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe  and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! [cheers and applause] Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today  General Flynn, who's here someplace  [cheers and applause]  I love General Flynn  but can you imagine these people saying  I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind? [laughter] We're going to hit them from the front, then  and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense? [laughter and applause] Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. [applause] Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of  probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS. My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life. But you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer. [laughter] Did anybody ever hit a hammer  you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people. [laughter] Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer  the old-fashioned way, I guess. [laughter]  The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum  did anybody see that? [cheers and applause] How did I do? [cheers] Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief. [cheers and applause] We had  the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? [laughter and cheers] AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait. Don't take her bait. MR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was  honestly, I shouldn't be saying this  she was terrible. [laughter] She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently. [laughter] It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered  an unheard-of practice  hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening. I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career. [laughter and cheers] It's true. It's true. [cheers and applause] So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough. [applause] But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did  [jeers]  to me, that was the tough one. [laughter] That was the tough  hey, that was a tough question. [laughter] It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? [laughter] Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons. [cheers and applause] True. True. [cheers and applause] She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad. [laughter] It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government. [applause] Have to do it.  And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians. [applause] And all of us through  and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country  millions of new jobs. [cheers and applause] We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy. That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses. [cheers and applause] It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations. [cheers and applause] It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege. [cheers and applause] I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me. [cheers and applause] We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. [cheers and applause] Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman. [applause] We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. [cheers and applause] Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that. [cheers and applause] Phyllis understood that. And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily  [cheers]  something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win. [applause] They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really  that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. [cheers and applause] We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do. There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us." AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen. MR. TRUMP: So true. [cheers and applause] So true. [applause] Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag. [cheers and applause] It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country. This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans. Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November. Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin. The citizens of this country will be in charge once more. The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing. The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people. This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible. Change is coming. All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop. It's your turn now. This is your time. The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change  not partisan change. We are fighting for all Americans  Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals  who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country. Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future. In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first  and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership  are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over. We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it. In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000. My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years. The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton  much of it to her personal bank account  to keep you from having the future you deserve. But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want. In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family. In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career. To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength. That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops. We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs. As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years. Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. One more massive Hillary Clinton failure. Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder. She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made. She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country. She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too  without any plan for the day after. She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property. And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons. Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch. Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength  not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton. The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States. Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again. That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world  so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again. If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing. I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States. But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children. We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn. America will get the respect it deserves. And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people. On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace  for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future. Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world. Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change  but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States. Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress. She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities. By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide. And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment. I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening. Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale. My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her. It's the powerful protecting the powerful. The insiders fighting for insiders. I am fighting for you. All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East. I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win  and how to avoid endless war. Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country. There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people. It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory. We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States  not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly. And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism. The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape. Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission. We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years. We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now. That applies to everything. Change is needed at every single level of our society. When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American. I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had. The possibilities for our future are unlimited. The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired. If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything. That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist  now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve. When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone  but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind. We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people. New schools, new factories, new infrastructure. Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing. Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty. Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans  from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over. These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures. To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion. All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump. In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers. I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine. My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back. This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again. Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation. Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice  and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition. Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com. Massive tax reductions and tax simplification  so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time. Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity. Once again, we will be One American Nation. We Will Be One American People. Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans. We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Prosperous Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!
This is our chance  our one chance  to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American. Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas. By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform. All of these reform plans are available on our website. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people. You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans. Above all else, you are Americans  and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you. Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House. Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests. I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments. I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better. We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy. I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America. We've released policy after policy, solution after solution. Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better. The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office. On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama. Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight  years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We are going to lift the restriction on American energy  this will create another half a million new jobs a year. That's just the beginning. On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs. I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country. On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers. You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com. North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it. Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization  another Hillary-backed deal. Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted. By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit. She even made her 13 different phones disappear  some of them were even destroyed with a hammer. Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State. Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family  in Haiti. Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale. Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law. She also believes that she is above all of you. After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country. She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a "basket of deplorables." She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings. She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options  what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first. Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people. For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country. Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them  she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign. She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity. She called these Americans every name in the book  racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic  she said they were not even American. Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter. She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans. What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks? To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better  and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone. Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change. The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete. Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President. Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans. I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States. These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars. These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation. We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice. There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people. Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting. One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world. We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life. The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration  and that have been dismissed by my opponent  are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself. We must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice. Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its  performance records available to consumers. The scandals never seem to end  but they will, when I'm elected President. Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform. We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe. Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes. Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign. We are on a mission of change. That includes a new agenda for our inner cities. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more. 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six. 2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. For those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose? Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools. I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future. In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans  and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods. We will keep our children safe  which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement. Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. Government corruption will end. Honesty will be restored. Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people. We will make America prosperous again. We will make America safe again. And will Make America great again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. I am honored to be here today. Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you. The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people. Our debt to you is eternal. Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City. Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas  including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world. Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country. If I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve. You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down. I am running to be a President for all Americans  and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform. All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics. They embody the goodness and decency of our country. I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign. Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future. These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book  she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic. She called them a "basket of deplorables" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings. Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street. She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium. Hillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power. Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run. She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families. While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians. After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts. She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over. Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation. It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya. To this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East  or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon. Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you. Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country. I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness. I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders. I am running to be your voice. Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents. The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service. You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens. Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all  she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt. If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign. Let's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks  it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee. Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook  smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people. She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform. People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected. People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe. People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence. Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies. The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities. Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans. We are the campaign of school choice. We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker. We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people. This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy. We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us. We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do  and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS. Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory. We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States. My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world. The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people. You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike. You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest. You are there to respond to every natural disaster. You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done. In a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office. You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day. You will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn. The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country. We will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind. Our gratitude is everlasting. We will protect those who protect us. And we will follow your example of unity  working in common purpose and common cause. We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. We will rebuild our military  and our country. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless you all.
Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today. I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues. We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers. Our campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family. I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe. Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first. We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected. We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power. Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare. That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids. We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone. These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs. For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense  even more than housing. Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area  and my opponent has no childcare plan. Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster  a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security. But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan. The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America  including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians  to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes. They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13. Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families. The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year. Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions to their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax  a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families. Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans  you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them. Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child. The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year  they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover  so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings. These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms I outlined last week. The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education. For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds  if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts. These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents. Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions. But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them. In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button  including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents. Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit. Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program. There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website. On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth. These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together  not as Republicans or Democrats  but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love your families, and want a better future for all Americans. It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people. It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead. It is time to Believe In America. Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again. We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again. And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.
Thank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign. Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again. The White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years. We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs. Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow  and they will grow rapidly. This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people. In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another  on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade. By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision. I am running to be a President for all Americans  Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people. Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation. It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear  including with a hammer  so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today. Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined. This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs  here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation. Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country. In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: "she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the officefrom the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true." The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home. 1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years. I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans. That includes our family farms right here in Iowa. Family farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms. We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief. Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death  helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America. My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy  which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year. That's just the beginning. Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs. By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the "lack of transparency," was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about  and I quote  "the stupidity of the American voter." This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton  and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back. Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice. This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty. It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation. Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities. We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs. Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours. To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose  vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools. I will make your communities safe. Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism. New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit. This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country. We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits. Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs. I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it. At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden  and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism. In all things, it's time to put Americans first  and start taking care of each other. Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children. On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans. I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA  which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first. And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States  not in China, and all over the world. We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again  like never before. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American metal into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Prosperous Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton. We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide. The people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people. This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens. For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves. There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970  today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest. Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government. It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America. This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own. It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. We are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people. Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure. This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America. But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools. They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs  safety, security, opportunity. Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes  we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results. I am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support. Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else  and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th. I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence. The economic policies of Hillary Clinton  on trade, on the economy, on immigration  have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution. Hillary Clinton believes in globalism  taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world  I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country. If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change  it's time to vote for America and America First. Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States. President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year. Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans. Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans. Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress. There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti. Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East  in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea. One failure after another  all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street. The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home. 1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled. I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. That begins with a new America-First trade policy. Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP  she called it the "Gold Standard." Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO. Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America. America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved  which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance. We won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote. My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy. Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion. In all things, it's time to put Americans first  and start taking care of each other. Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children. On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans. I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA  which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first. And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States  not in China, and all over the world. We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again  like never before. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival  it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country. My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams. Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans. Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM  today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico. It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. We are going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources. Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success. Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism  which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country  and replace it with a new policy of Americanism. Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries. Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation. My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution  a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests. In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed. In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances. In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries. Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there. Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable  how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption? The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos  but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice. I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country. Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration. I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States  and as your President, I will fight for every last American job. We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon. It's time to start thinking big once again. That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math. This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit. It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies. Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter  that translates to millions of lost jobs. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs. Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty. On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt  it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion. Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure. Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce. Never has so much money been spent so poorly. But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how. It begins with bold new tax reform. As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all  in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely. By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs. In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit  it won't even be close. This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation. Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit  in the form a Childcare rebate  and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all. One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate  down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch. We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment. On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country. We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs  and that means jobs in our poorest communities. Next, comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy. Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry  and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to. In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars. I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills. We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work. Energy reform is central to our plan as well According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person. Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars. A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama  creating countless more jobs in the process. Finally, comes trade  the foundation for everything America's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year  an enormous drag on growth. Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent. Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country. It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted  every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality. Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000. I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators  and I know who you are, many of you are in the room. We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed. We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules. If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists. Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year. We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country. Here is how the plan adds up We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan. Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost. That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade  again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements. If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs. This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country. This is what our new future will look like I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA  and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first. And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American metal into the spine of this country. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees. New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country  including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide. Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House. It's going to be a victory for the people  it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens. And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time. I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans. I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people. Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic  but above all else, you are American. Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals. We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers  as well as law enforcement officers across the country. And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run. While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country. Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book  and Americans have had enough. They want solutions, and they want better lives  not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians. People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected. People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe. People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence. Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians. Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation. It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS. Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future. That future begins with prosperity at home. My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs. One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership. Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress  and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools. 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working. These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering. Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years  her disastrous record speaks for itself. The only people she delivers for is her donors. I am going to deliver for you, the American people. If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in. We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy  which means at least another half a million new jobs a year. That's just the beginning. Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare  this will instantly save another 2 million jobs. I am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down. Another major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice. This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty. Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children. Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children. On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans. We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression. The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them  and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people. Let's also talk about Venezuela. Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists. The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free. Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people. I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA  and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Prosperous Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives  and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims. I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will. I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice. You are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents. The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office. Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child. It's happening every single day. All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws. There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO. Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home? What do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country? What do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars? This must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders. Just look at what's happened in the last few days. Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period. Earlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday. A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported  but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach  the other victim is a mother and a grandmother. When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens. According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch  she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it. Now, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain. She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates. Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America. Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order  violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril. Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country. But the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody  or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law. Your cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient. But help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim. Together, we will save American lives  and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today. Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities  these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation. According to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases. At the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe. Whether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger  they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis. Let's just remember our goal  to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate. That is what is at stake in this election. So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak. [INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK] These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. I am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.
Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina. Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. We are going to bring back your jobs. We are going to cut your taxes. We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals. And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country. Attack after attack  from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando  we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger. So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security. My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term  with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs. This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country. My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day  and I will never waver in that sacred obligation. It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States. Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable. Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed. In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism. Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign  many of them cops and soldiers  deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty  where is Hillary's condemnation here? Let's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable  or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump? America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists. Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President. The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values  and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way. It's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch. Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us. Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies  these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster. So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure. Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying. When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides "aid and comfort," to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks. ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger  just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State. The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy. Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy? Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today  and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores. We must stop the massive inflow of refugees  which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion  such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith are commonplace. It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President. It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past. It is time to have a new American Future. We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values. We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare. But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home. We are going to rebuild our country. And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities. Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty. To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it  I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before. It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs. My whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs  just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals. Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through. The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs  instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled. Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal  and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away. Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year  this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton. But we are going to turn it all around. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States; We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania. Great polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide. On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country. At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety. We are going to Make America Safe Again. The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended. The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace. Who is looking out for them? For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school. To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you. The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law. I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community. I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens. But to do this, we must work with our police  not against our police. Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society  a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent  share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least. Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives. 65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday. The problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police. Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed. But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos. Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city  it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country. Who is there to represent these families? Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones. We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity. Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change  it's time for a New American Future. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children." Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say." At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents. And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society. Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment. But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs. This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change. The changes will start immediately. On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses. This will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape. Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs. We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year. But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country. That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses. Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way. Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton. The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries  we are going to bring them back. Jobs will come flowing back in all over America. It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. We're going to turn it all around. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign  and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens. 95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you  visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement. Let me tell you what else we're going to do. One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973. But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt. Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs. But they should be using the money on the students  for tuition, for student life, and for student housing. On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans. Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college  but to increase it. We have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars  paid for by you  that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students. Another major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened  the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time. Just one more Washington lie  like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. It's a disaster. That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare. Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens  bankrupting these programs for Americans. She doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that  they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America  and America First. Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams. Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity  where others saw only problems, I saw only potential. We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families. That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people. I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses  I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions. We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be  all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers. We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers  and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation. It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan. It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. You have 46 days to change the world. You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before. Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Good morning. Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction. I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans. Let me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm. It is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation. Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times  but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country  and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens. We all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country. Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand.  Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities. We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace. Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end. The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer  and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration. Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace. For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone. Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American. This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives. Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable. We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again. I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates  and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country. My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority. Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities. That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent. We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas  hunted down for execution  continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth. Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return. Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed. But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos. They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota. In addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income. This brings us to the subject of energy. Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again  especially for the poorest Americans. America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy  some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves. It's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices. I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities  including right here in Pennsylvania. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama  creating countless more jobs in the process. Overall, my entire economic plan  tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform  will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth. My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today  turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent. Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut  including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts. My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year. On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow. Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term. It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history. Compare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system. Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas. This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy. Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources. She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace. According to the Wall Street Journal, "Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo." Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others. Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda. The platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a "price on carbon." That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production  a tax on American consumers. And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country  often foreign countries not very friendly to us. That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards. That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves. We need an America-First energy plan. This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies. The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions  more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country. Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars. She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production  which supports 10 million jobs in the United States. Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families. At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel. But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general. Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development. Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production. Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources. That means we will end the war on coal. I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration. We will eliminate the highly-invasive "Waters of the US" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate. I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans. I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas. It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success. It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions. It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th. We Will make America Wealthy Again. We Will make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees. Tremendous polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide. On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. We are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media  we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries. We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America. We will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores. We will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs. The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor  we will remove those restrictions day one. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. President Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000. Our replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market  they will be competing for your business. We're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks. High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need. On trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets. Our massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class  and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders. There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent. Hillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests. I am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women. My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children." Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say." At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents. And just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits. Families can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class. We have also talked about improving education. My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America. We are also going to bring down the cost of college. Universities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments  but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students. I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt. This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it. Women also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment. But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs. This must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change. The changes will start immediately. Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work. Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion. By the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year. We are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia. Another major part of our agenda is safety. I believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace. Today, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation. African-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation. Many African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported. At the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty. I will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream. That includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice. Democrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty. The jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising. To those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has before. The policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities  just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went. Of course, she got rich through it all  the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State. Worst of all, she put her public office up for sale  and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign  and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens. 95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you. Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America  and America First. Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams. Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity  where others saw only problems, I saw only potential. We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families. That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people. I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses  I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions. We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be  all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers. We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers  and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation. It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan. It used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. We'll turn it all around. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. You have 44 days until the big vote. You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before. Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration  and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. And we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Hillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge. It reads: "I'm With Her." I have a different pledge: I'm With You  the American People. To all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends  including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad. We are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points. On November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people. We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans. We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country. Lower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service. Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders. I am an outsider fighting for you. Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton  or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks. She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia. She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. We can't let that happen. That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails. The Clintons have perfected the politics of profit. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country. The American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens. How many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past. We are the bright future. While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions. Never in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton. This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough. It's time for real change  a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. From now on, it's going to be America First. Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen? Why can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want? Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers? The answer is simple. Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen. These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors. Look at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea. She failed upstate New York. She failed the inner cities. She's failed women and children. I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty. And she has been a disaster on our borders. I'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities. Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah? The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Just Follow The Money. Her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. That includes keeping your family safe. New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January. 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American. 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty. I will never back down from fighting to save American lives. I will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations  including on our farmers  negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child  including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Remember: Follow the Money. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country. Government will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines. An article in the New York Post was published recently called "How Donald Trump helped save New York City." The article said, quote: "Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out Trump  almost by force of will  rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead." That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th  and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is so important. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help. You have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before. Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It's so great to be in Wisconsin tonight. A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll  and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton. On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service. Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself. I am an outsider fighting for you. One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight. New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year. This is a national crisis. Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters  many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters  deplorable and irredeemable. Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of "implicit bias,"  essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced. Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as "super-predators." How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens? How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables? By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President. She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace. The police officers she attacks are the same people  of all colors and nationalities  who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers. Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens. My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives. The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache. Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us. I will never back down from fighting to save American lives. I will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities. The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. 58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty. The inner cities have been left behind. Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it. I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms. She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton  or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.

This will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough. Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. From now on, it's going to be America First. These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money. Look at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS  in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world. She failed upstate New York  promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway. She failed the inner cities. She's failed women and children. The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. I'm not owned or controlled by anyone  my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child  including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job. The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Follow the Money. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th. Government will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines. That's what I want to do for our country  I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th  and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help. You have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. Don't let it slip away. Don't let this chance go. Stand up and be heard  for your family, for your city, for your country. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before. Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey. I've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free. We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House. We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans. We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American. We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service. Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I am an outsider fighting for you. Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. Again, just follow the money. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power  to keep their control over this country. The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens. The Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future. While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions. This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." Same thing goes for Hispanic voters  they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people. My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs. Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order. We will unleash the power of American energy  we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people. Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice. The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton  and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership  which would destroy manufacturing in this state. Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. From now on, it's going to be America First. Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen? Think about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students? All the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied. The reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen. These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. That includes keeping your family safe. New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January. The failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo. Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us. We will never back down from fighting to save American lives. That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can't even say the words. We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled  once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people. I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border  that is a promise. The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help. You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before. Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country: We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!
I am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country. In 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House. It is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people. We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class. We are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity  a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a  depleted military. It is time to rebuild Detroit. It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America. Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich  by taking your jobs and your money away from you. That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the "Gold Standard." The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country. Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP  and their wish is her command. These special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY. Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty. Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors. Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation. 9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches. Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation. At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign. On November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST. Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I am an outsider fighting for you. Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system. We are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American. We have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige. The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans. They don't believe in secure borders and strong walls. These Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools. For decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem  and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote. When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired. In their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy  they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale  and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails. We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration? And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself? No one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton. Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on  power  to keep their control over this country. Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money? The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens. This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton  they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over  she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." To the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods. If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI. This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton. A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people. My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated. We will unleash the power of American energy. The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated  and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing. Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO  both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico. It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs. Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal "will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive." She pledged to reject the deal. But she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails. Once installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a "cutting-edge deal." She rammed it through to adoption  she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities. The U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state. According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do. Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a "global community of stakeholders." Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a "global community." It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country. Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen? The reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your  family. Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs. Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors  we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th. You have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed  for your country come true. Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the  American voter. On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back  Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before. Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country: We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars  made in Michigan  will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation  and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. To the people of Michigan, I promise you this  We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, and God Bless!
This is such an amazing city. It's called "Home of the Heroes," because of your proud tradition of military service. Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients. As President Eisenhower said, there must be "something in the water out there in Pueblo" because "all you guys turn out to be heroes." Colorado is home to six military bases. We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military. Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment. One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas. We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work. I have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan and the largest regulatory reform in American history. That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are. A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans. Along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President. I've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists. It is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws  all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests. It's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it. Many so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent. The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time  despite being a beneficiary. I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them  and that is what I commit to doing. As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees. I have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required  or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible. As a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes. It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible  which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities  and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business. The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history. The conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008. What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically  and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general. Many business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost  and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt. Yet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before. That did not happen by chance or luck  it happened by action, and talent. I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did. In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed. Those who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties. People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling  government favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life  or added a single dollar of value to the American economy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life  all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors  for astronomical dollars and like never before. It's corruption of the highest order. While I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale. By her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars  without building a company, or creating a single thing of value.  During the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back. They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out. But, I never had any doubts and never gave up. That's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best. And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise. Just look at what happened in the primary. Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now. The reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight. That's what I am  a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you. With my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business. That is why I am here today. That is why I have left private business for public life  because I  understand our country is in very bad shape. And now our country is in need of a major comeback  it needs one now more than ever. We owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story  we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year. Our country is broke. We have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a  monthly basis. This is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children. And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around  starting today. What I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction. We cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse. We can turn this all around  but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW. The failed political establishment must go  it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most. In the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished. Everybody said that I was done  there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories. So they said I was finished. The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump. I started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company. When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same  but the value of the assets plummeted. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not. My understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again. Now, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country. The early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people. These are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again. These tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess  but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win. That's the thinking we need for our country  that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people. Put me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you. Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors. I am here fighting for America. Many people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen  I've proven that over and over again. That's what I do. When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done  that's when I am just getting started. The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point. From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers. On November 8th, America's comeback begins  and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before. The people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country. This is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state. Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans. And, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American. Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs. This is the change I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home. She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens. She opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools. We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice. Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it  Obamacare is an absolute disaster. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent  the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump. Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization  and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the "Gold Standard." Colorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals. But while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State. To hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate. The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation. We have become a Banana Republic. Now, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY  their laptops. Let me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up. Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it  by showing up and voting on November 8th. People have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption. This is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough. The Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future. Now, another issue I want to address today is immigration. As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants. It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy. Illegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today. Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs  including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado. We are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado. We are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many. Cases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant. Or cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama  and then released again after the killing. There are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out  and we are going to get them out quickly. To the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end. We also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington. Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. Terrorists are infiltrating our country. Now, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees  from across the Middle East. I want to keep you and your family safe. My job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America  putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first. If you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system. Immigration Security is National Security. Here are some more things we will do starting in 2017  We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are going to rebuild America. We are going to revitalize America. And we are going to unite America. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, and God Bless!
It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services. Before we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security. To truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector. Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States. As President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration. One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure. Cyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns. Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way. The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter "C" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office. The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks. Just consider some of these recent hacks: JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen. E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords. Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers. Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary. Identify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware  involving the extortion of a hacked institution  are all becoming increasingly common. Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations. The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail. The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed. We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time. We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society. As President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime. I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command. As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned. Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well. For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability  no matter how difficult  to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists. To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology. The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits. I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved. The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies. This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees. The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur. This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices. They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense. Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice. Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.
Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona. In 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. I am going to make America Rich again. I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses. My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs. I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change  she is four more years of Obama. Clinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse  she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities. Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did. I know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures. Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million. I know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family. I've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office. The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around. Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama. Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country. The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years. Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country. Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need. Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year. The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds. We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. We are nation divided, with race riots in the streets. Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs  or certainly not the jobs they want. Overseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos. Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services. America needs a turnaround. America needs a comeback. America needs a change. That is why I am running. First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. The architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie  he called it the "stupidity of the American voter." But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people. Do you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000. Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare. He has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country." Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said: He just said it's a "crazy system," where people end up with "premiums doubled and coverage cut in half." He said "it's the craziest thing in the world." Bill Clinton said: "people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfthe people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work." I couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. This is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year. There is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can. Next, we are going to unleash American energy I just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States. As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy. Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens. We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on. Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries. When I am President, we will start making things in America again. Companies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country. Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average. Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries. As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines. We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries. And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers. We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat. Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States. Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border. A nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation. A country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country. A government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead. Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens. Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody. Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal. In California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported. Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17  he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer  but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported. A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now  when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly. On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher. At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington. Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country. Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary is for open borders. I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First. For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers. We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe. We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end  beginning in January of 2017. We are going to end the government corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate. The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation. We have become a Banana Republic. Yesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops. Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it  by sending in your ballots. We are also going to fix our inner cities 45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities. To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it. To everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose? We will have safe communities for EVERYONE. School choice for your children. Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country. Everyone will be included in the American Dream. Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We are going to rebuild America. We are going to revitalize America. And we are going to unite America. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time. You are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again. A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs. It's a vote for a government of, by and for the people. All together, we are going to  Make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you. It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada  a state where I have so many great friends and employees. In 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House. How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night? Mike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates. Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice. While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse  she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction  she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities. She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry. I am running to represent Americans  and we are going to make America Rich again. I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses. My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs. The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around. Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama. Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country. The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years. Our police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported  and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist. Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country. Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need. Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year. The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds. We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.

Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services. America needs a turnaround. America needs a comeback. America needs a change. That is why I am running. On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back  bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before. First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. That was a lie. He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000. Another lie. Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare. Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country." Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said: He just said it's a "crazy system," and that "it's the craziest thing in the world." Bill said: "people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfthe people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work." On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd. Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens. We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on. Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries. When I am President, we will start making things in America again. Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. As the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines. Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973. We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States. Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries. And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers. We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat. We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the "Gold Standard." The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command. She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I am an outsider fighting for YOU. We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history. Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade. America will become the great jobs magnet of the world. Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay and new hope. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border. Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead. Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody. Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal. In California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported. Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17  he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country. There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely  when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly. All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today  and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security. At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this  they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence. The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country. Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary is for open borders. I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First. For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers. We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens  your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end. We are also going to end the government corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops. Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots. We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it. I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace. Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation. I want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job. Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people. I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time. A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your country. All together, we are going to  Make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you. I am so thrilled to be here in Reno With your help, in 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back our jobs. We are going to make America rich again. I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse  it's been 30 years of failure. The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around. Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama. Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country. The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years. Heroin overdoses are surging, and meth overdoses in Nevada are up 22 percent. Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare  even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need. Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year. The federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds. We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. On top of it all, our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services. America needs a turnaround. America needs a comeback. America needs a change. And that change is coming on November 8th. We are going to show the whole world that America is back  bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before. First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare. Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country." Bill has a different view. Here is what bill said: He just said it's a "crazy system," and that "it's the craziest thing in the world." Bill said: "people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in halfthe people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work." There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd. With your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada. Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors. Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival My economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. But to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals  and stand up to countries that cheat. China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money  the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens. We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on. Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries. When I am President, we will start making things in America again. Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average. The jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country. I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country  and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country. It's going to be a new day in America. For too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States. Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries. And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers. We will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history. Thousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border. Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders. In fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals. But she didn't do it. The ICE officers, who endorsed me  their first endorsement of a candidate ever  issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans. Let me read from it. Again, this all a quote from the ICE officers: "Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." "Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders." Their quote continues. "She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees." The ICE officers conclude by saying: "Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders." That whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying. The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States  anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation. There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely  when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly. At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country  as was the mall shooter in Washington State. The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan. Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. I am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First. We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We are also going to end the government corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails  after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate. Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops. Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote. We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it. I will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities. I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation. Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time. A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your future. You are voting to believe in your country. All together, we are going to  Make America wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We are going to make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again.
The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments. The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country. Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation. Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena  and then destroyed her phones with a hammer  all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars. These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations. ... Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed "serious concerns" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti. New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from "Friends of Bill" or "William Jefferson Clinton VIPs" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment. People who were labeled "Not Friends of Bill" were placed on the sidelines. In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer. The company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills. Today, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time. To all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th. Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist. I'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel. The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. The emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign. To all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and  as confirmed by Wikileaks  she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security. ... Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged. Reporters who work for these outlets  like the Washington Post, or the New York Times  may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine. The emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption. The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: "from time to time I get the questions in advance." The media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people. ... On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country. I am asking all Americans  Republicans, Independents and Democrats  to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time. A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you everybody. This is a big, big crowd, you know? [applause] I'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. [applause] So, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. [applause] Look, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? [applause] Go ahead cameras. [applause] They never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. [applause] We love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. [applause] In 27 days, we're going to win Florida [applause] and we're going to win back the White House. [applause] And that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. [applause] We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. [booing] We're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. [applause] We're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. [applause] And when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. [applause] And we are going to once again put America first. [applause] The deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? [applause] There's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. [applause] They just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. [applause] Seriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. [applause] Because with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? [applause] So go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. [applause] Also, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. The Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.  The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close.  The WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign. So think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.  He was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees. But he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. [booing] I think most of us know what happened. [booing] So fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear [booing] Did you ever hear anything like this? [booing] And, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. [applause] Here you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control. And the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.  I would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night. These are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on. This corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. [applause] Our country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.  But look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important.  We have to investigate the investigation. [applause] We have to investigate the investigation. [applause] We've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.  Normally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.  Remember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.  But think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. [applause] And I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. [applause] Other people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this.  So we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. [booing] Now, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.  But all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.  I'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this?  This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?  Folks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. [applause] Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.  So she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. [applause] So then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena. Now, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. [applause] And then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group. And what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK?  Obviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? [applause] They're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, "Oh, we got rid of most of it." That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.  So then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in?  I see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.  And they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, "serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department."  Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. [applause] Never is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption.  They understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly. This will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you.  They despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in.  As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.  And remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad.  Look, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. [applause] And by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? [applause] So they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. "Time Magazine" had like a massive look, "Time Magazine" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines.  But "Time Magazine" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward[applause] I do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas. As Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. [applause] And it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote. The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. [booing] Viciously. [booing] And that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. [applause] And in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. [applause] Remember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. [applause] These emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. [applause] Hey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. [applause] And how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that?  I'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well.  Hillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. [applause] I actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. [applause] And it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. [applause] Call it Florida, right? Florida. [applause] Emails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. [applause] And we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.  This all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie. He made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers. So all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.  And by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? [applause] That's a lot of money. [applause] And I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. [laughter] I'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. [applause] You know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... [applause] They said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong.  If I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.  We're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?  More Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. [booing] See? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. [applause] Amazing. [applause] I think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly? A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. [applause] Big, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. [booing]  It's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.  And my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates? And I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. [applause] Won in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system [applause] By far. Wasn't even close. [applause] Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. [booing] And this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous. He asked me the first question, "Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did. John Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons. And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, "Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?"  This system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said. I'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power. I used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple. My life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going. I built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex. You know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less.  Not a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before. OK? That I can tell you. [applause] Including being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. [applause] Which is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, "I feel great. I lost a lot of weight."  By the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. [applause] Oh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous. The corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. [applause] The e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in.  550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [applause] And why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody.  Last year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. [booing] Who the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. [applause] Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left.  Tell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. [applause] She doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people[booing] Instead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it—I'm not bragging, I'm just saying—maybe a little bit, but here—he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. [applause] So wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that.  There's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.  Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump.  Two hundred. Over 200. [applause] Twenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump.  American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.  We're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. [applause] I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. [applause] Oh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. [applause] We will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. [applause] And yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection [applause] But Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. [booing] I don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. [booing] Not nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. [applause] I don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having—and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they—we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.  But we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched.  Couldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. [applause] And I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me—and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. [applause] That's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. [applause] Because we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job.  These are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. [applause] And one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts—sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them.  Because they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. [applause] One convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free—totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders.  Casey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son—had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here.  And you have—you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. [applause] A Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. [applause] We will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. [applause] Are you ready? Are you ready? [applause] And who is going to pay for the wall? Audience: "Mexico" 100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall. Hey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally.  We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that—think if you have a child—470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids.  We're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. [applause] We will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. [applause] But I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. [applause] Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. [booing] This, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate—she knows it—they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands.  We can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years.  In fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. [booing] So let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] She won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president—I call him our campaign president—our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse.  And remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries.  And she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying—they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping.  And by the way, she likes to say, they want me—I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. [applause] And she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there.  It turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things. She put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is.  She gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened. You see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. [applause] You see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, "Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right.  And the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not. And when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters. Right, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia. You ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.  They have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, "Donald Trump is friends with Putin." I don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin. What the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con. And this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right. You know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over. You look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign. You know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough. So, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare. How about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.  The only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. [booing] A Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing.  And keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word "keep" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less Text It's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online. ISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it.  At the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. [applause] And that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. [applause] But it's got to be there. [applause] And just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. [applause] My enemy—our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet. This means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.  We also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. [applause] Bill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this?  Oh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster.  Obamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. [applause] As you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.  This is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and—and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote.  At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part.  And then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back.  When countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these—everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it.  We are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help.  We've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. [applause] And they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me. And they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States [applause] And if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. [applause] We are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.  We're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again.  We are going to make our country very safe again. [applause] We are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.
Thank you. I am so happy to be back here in Columbus. Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same. We are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes. And we've only begun to fight. If we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair. We are the campaign of change. We will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations. I've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter. So they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations  but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign. In an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all. I want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future. Right now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit. The greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same  they collaborate and conspire together. This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us. These are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory. These are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities. These are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer. These are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children. These are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries. The political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty. At the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors  including foreign government and foreign actors. Hillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena. She ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans  and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack. She defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim  and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for "open borders." That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures  she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors. We won't let it happen. Hillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools. Under a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice. Under President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled. $20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off. The new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over. Yet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition. The share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration. In a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials. First, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis. Tuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago. In all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide. Students should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives. That is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives. That's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today. Every American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college. In addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students. If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt. Some schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition. We want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition. Much of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions. Federal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations. As president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition. I will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced. We will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue. We also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance. I will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school. There is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance optionseach of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years. We also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do. Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing  jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans. We will protect these jobs for Americans. My economic plan  including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms  will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year. This includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process. Finally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law. A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Together, we are going to make America great again.
Thank you, it is so great to be here in Florida. In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House. Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People. There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense. The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself. The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists. For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat. This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government. The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago  and yet they are working harder. It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan  and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs. The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers. And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election. With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before  and we won't let them do that. The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it is a war  and for them, nothing is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system. This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it. The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more. The Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on. People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything. And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack. It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine  including 2,000 more emails this morning These claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false  and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears. What's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine  and that magazine should be put out of business. Six months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks. We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it  just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things. That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago  another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing. Also, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election. This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony  the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false. This weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it. This is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile. I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people. But let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime  indeed one the most important elections in modern history  and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead. So now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed  in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government. When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones. I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me. But I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back. Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning. We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty. But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people. Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited. Our political establishment has no soul. I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve. The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People. They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States  in the back of her airplane, while on the runway  for 39 minutes  to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more  and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less. This is a conspiracy against you, the American people. This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization. I didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back. Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people. In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else  and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right  and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again. The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future  but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future. If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person  which is what our country needs  will ever again run for this office. I will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful. What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description. But I also know, it's not about me  it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country. It's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution. This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver. This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace. We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters. We will vote for the country we want. We will vote for the future we want. We will vote for the politics we want. We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country  and the disenfranchisement of our people. Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.
Thank you. In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. We are going to deliver real change that puts America First. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration. We are going to be a rich country again. We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency  and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense. The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger. They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti. They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign. To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional Subpoena  she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing. Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history. Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President. But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started. Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration. When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States. Either we win the election, or we lose the country. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth. When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you  we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves. New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country. We have to solve this crisis. I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue. Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction. We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation. Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic. First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country. The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008. I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good. We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation. We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country. We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs. President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals. Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels. Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service. These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S. A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission. Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse. It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help. The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat. Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need. As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision. At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids. Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need. Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step. I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction. I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment. I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives. I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention. Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs. But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis. The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams. At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals. 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton. The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico. Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico. If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal. We are going to start making things in America again. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country. Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive. We will lower taxes massively on all Americans  Hillary will raise your taxes massively. We will become the great jobs magnet of the world. Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we are going to make America great again.
Thank you. In 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House. Make sure to get your absentee ballots. Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration. We are going to be a rich country again. We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs  her private position  then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud. Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional Subpoena  she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing. Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history. Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President. But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We have only just begun to fight. Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers. By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration. Either we win the election, or we lose the country. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road. What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors? As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head  after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick. A wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth. Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace. I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction. But, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis. At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals. 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton. When I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again. We'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports. The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal. We are going to start making things in America again. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. We will lower taxes massively on all Americans  Hillary will raise your taxes massively. Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class  this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare. Reagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms  on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy  will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history. We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land. President Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new "National Monument." No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine. But we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors. I'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable  and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens. I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America powerful again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.
Thank you. In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House. Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots. Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration. We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President. Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification. This is a criminal conspiracy  a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI. Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times. We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense. But it gets even worse. The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a "quid pro quo." This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign. Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all. This is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. But there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, "take the money!!" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments. Remember, we are competing in a rigged election  the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved  Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate. A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common. The following comes straight from Pew Research. QUOTE: "Approximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate." QUOTE: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters." QUOTE: "Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state." Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: "could non-citizens decide the November election?" Here are some excerpts. QUOTE: "More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote." QUOTE: "Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin." Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence. We will not let that happen. It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do  he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash. So, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order. Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists. Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections. Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals. 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China. GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico. Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China. The list goes on and on. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. National Security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars. By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration. In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are "Un-American." So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. The ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." Here is a summary of the Hillary plan: --Support for Sanctuary Cities --Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens --Obamacare for illegal immigrants --No deportation of visa overstays --Expanding catch-and-release on the border --Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers --Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives --A 550% increase in Syrian refugees Either we win this election, or we lose the country. Under a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors. And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
In 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House. We're going to take it back. [applause] And while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th.  I'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. [applause] I've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. [applause] Great people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. [applause] We're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. [applause] We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. [applause] Unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. [applause] Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. [applause] Your country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. [applause] Very dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster.  Under my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. [applause] China's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. [applause] We're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest.  And yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. [applause] So bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. [applause] She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. [applause] It's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. [applause] The FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. [applause] The media barely covers this event, by the way. [applause] This is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. [applause] Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. [applause] Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter "C" meant confidential information was classified. [applause] She thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. [applause] There's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on.  Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. [applause] This elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. [applause] This truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. [applause] Going to do it. [applause] Another series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. [applause] The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament.  But I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. [applause] That she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.  Some people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. [applause] Now even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show.  Believe me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. [applause] At her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? [applause] Sort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.  They said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, "Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen."  Change stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories.  Without the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really—she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor.  I mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way—here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? [applause] They are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it—this is in the New York Times "balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy."  Can you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.  History is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country.  I have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes.  We have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out—they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace.  But we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, "You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say." [applause] Get out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, "Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say."  Well, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all—and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you. In 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, "Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, "Oh, this—everything is peachy-dory," right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me.  The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA—or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster—NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world.  We're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants.  And for completely open borders—she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and—and just remember this—run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence.  And by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th.  So hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling. It is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?  Second, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in.  I'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves [applause] Right? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. [applause] We have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to—we have no—do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. [booing] And remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people. And they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States.  And when I said, "undo it," they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth.  My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. [applause] At the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country.  We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.  And this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.  We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. [applause] As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause] We are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities—45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago.  Can you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years.  So you don't—they don't seem to. She said, "nobody cares." And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. [applause] We will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, "See you in four years." They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.  They want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. [applause] Our national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank [applause] I promise, we will build the wall. [applause] Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country. Simple as that. There are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.  But in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, "Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American." In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.  We will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.  So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. [applause] We have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. [applause] We just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back.  So we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.  The ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, "The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities.  She wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, "Oh, you can go."  Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even—there go your jobs—freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.  And this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. [booing] Either we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. [applause] Here are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them—good news—fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good.  We're going to have—and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. [applause] We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] Law and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. [applause] And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] You have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you.  I am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds.  I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. [applause] I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. [applause] And with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause] Thank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before.  You're going to look back at this election and say, "This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time." [applause] Once again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause] You will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. [applause] We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. [applause]
Thank you. In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House. Early voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person. Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election  if I win! ALTERNATE: Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept  without delay or hesitation  the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Now, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10. The question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country. John Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses. One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections. A campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything. And a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies  is a candidate who is truly capable of anything. In addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile  who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race  she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate? Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question  he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency. So it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore. In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead  which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved). 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state. And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote. So what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful. America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed. Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me. But, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th. Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration. Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years. Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money. Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border. Right now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests  Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries. That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. Those reforms include the following: A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service. A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. It's about time. Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs. At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals. 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization  two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country. I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation. American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative. In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States. It's going to be America First. As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are also going to rebuild our inner cities. African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse. To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. National Security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant. If I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. We are going to save American lives. Either we win this election, or we lose the country. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. Because if we win  We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. In 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House. Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily. Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot. Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration. We will be a strong nation again. American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia. Strength will also require growth. Right now, our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years. Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money. Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border. Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries  including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's how our system is corrupt and broken. We're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense. The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile  who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. Hillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate. Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question  a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency. Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance  more pay-for-play. That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. Those reforms include the following: A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation. My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals. 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps. We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country. We are going to start making things in America again  and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again. In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy. American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative. In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office. It will report to what we call the American Desk. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States. It's going to be America First.

If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road. A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported  but never was. What kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors? Either we win this election, or we lose the country. A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. Because if we win  We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. In 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House. But you have to vote on November 8th. Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns  raised from special interests  and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily. Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First. We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration. We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military. Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort. As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more. We will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet. We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania. As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure. Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years  but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country. We're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it. Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia. Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy. This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed "structurally deficient." We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania  shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation. Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA  a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization. Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: "Trenton Makes, The World Takes." Under a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again  and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again. Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs. Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries. She's the most corrupt person ever to run for President. She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional subpoena  lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer  and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing. Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance  more pay-for-play. That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business. I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated. We're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations  the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests. I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation. My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are also going to rebuild our inner cities. African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety. Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse. To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores. She even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road. A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported  but never was. If I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported. And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens. Either we win this election, or we lose the country. A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. For the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths. This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People. I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence. I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. If we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you. [applause] Thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you please sit down. Thank you. It's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place.  President Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation. I'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me. But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer.  Our country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act. [applause] I've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years. I've been a major part of it.  I know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans. The rules are rigged.  Nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working. One in five households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty. We have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities. We've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don't know how to win the wars at home.  We have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.  Change has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken. The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime. [applause] The system is totally rigged and broken. First, the issue of voter fraud. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate. And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable.  1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens.  2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks. These are numbers.  Fourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times. She recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall. Well, that's a lies. Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example.  It was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI. He said he did that for national security reasons.  Highly respected man. A four-star general. This took place two days ago. How must he feel. A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions. Why is she allowed to run? The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption. They're corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible. At my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.  On the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it.  Over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles. But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refused to talk about it.  They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN. A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. Likewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes. It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country. Very very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. They should be paying those taxes. Additionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.  This should never ever have been approved in the first place. They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total Fabrication. The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever. Here is why this is relevant to you. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you. Your jobs. Your security. Your education. Your healthcare. The violation of religious liberty. The theft of your second amendment. The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more. Look at what they've done to you with your jobs. It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives. Now, we didn't know this. We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape. We didn't know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. These were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.  This is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted. But because of the rigged system they probably won't be. Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing. The rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense. I have no special interest but you the American Vogel. [applause] I didn't have to do this, believe me. There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it.  I love our country.  I love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it. [applause] Thank you. One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place. Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. [applause] We now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country. [applause] I think it does. I know it does.  My economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. Now, our jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to so many other countries. It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change.  Believe me it's going to change. [applause] And that goes for all countries. When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen. They're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade. We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real. My security plan, so important. They've taken the jobs from us.  My security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities. My ethics plan will end corruption in our government. [applause] We will. Corruption is massive. We will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. [applause] That is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character. [applause] I am asking the American people to dream big once again. What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter  and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:  FIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. [applause] SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health. [applause] THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. [applause] FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune. [applause] FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.[applause] SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening. [applause] On the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that. We're going to change that very very fast. FIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. [applause] SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country. [applause] THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them. They have been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop so easy to stand. FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. [applause] FIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves, [applause] including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work. SIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward. We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen. Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country. SEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs [applause] and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure. We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We're going to fix our own environment. [applause]. Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law. We have to do that. FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama. SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice? I just found that out this morning. From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] THIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities. [applause]  FOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back [applause] and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him. She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him. There won't be one such instance if I become president. [applause] FIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. [applause] And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%. Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can't allow that to happen [applause] we have enough problems. [applause] All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:  1. Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. [applause] We need that so badly. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. [applause] Who have been forgotten. Called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut. And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. [applause] The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. It's stuck. We can't bring it back. Two and a half to five trillion dollars. Companies can't get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. [applause]  2. The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. [applause]  They leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others. They leave the United States and fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making. They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me [applause] but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have? We have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences. We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences. And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries. 3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama. In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added. Think of it and we haven't fixed anything. We haven't fixed anything. What have we doe? Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt. All-time high. That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape. VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that [applause] because our veterans are not treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans [applause] and we're not going to have that. It is revenue neutral.  4. School Choice and Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. [applause] And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities.  We do so badly on education. If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top. You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close. We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close. We're at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. [applause] It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.  Have you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall [laughter] we're going to need them [laughter] we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again. [applause] Those are people those are great people. 5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. [applause] Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that. The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines. We have to do it because that's competition. The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up. Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years. And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug. They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved. We are going to speed up that process very significantly 6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. [applause] so good 7. End Illegal Immigration Act. [applause] Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it. Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall. Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 ½ months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person. But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway.  We have our people. We have out take care of our people. Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal. But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back, they go to prison for quite a while. They come back, they come back again they go five years. Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed. Five times. But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times. When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequence.  Also reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. [applause] 8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me. We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars [applause] or out of our country and into the country where they came from. [applause] 9. Restoring National Security Act. Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment. Now, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now. We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength. We need a strong military. [applause] Our military is so terribly depleted. It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support. But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day. But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line. We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we will pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable. [applause] Also, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values [applause] we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. [applause]  We want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't. Just come on in folks. Just come on in. 10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. [applause] And importantly we will Make America Great Again. Believe me.
Thank you. It's great to be back here in beautiful Naples. In 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House. Early voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting. Yesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter  a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government. One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme. My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price. So I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America  because we are all just One America. It's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests. And my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C. That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First. Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Next, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia  she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office. Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal  and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages. Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more  including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before. In the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding "many billions," in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint. The humiliation for our country never seems to end  and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in. To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer  and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place. The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat  she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash. The Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation. When I am President, America will be respected in the world once again. That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home. If you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan. This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle. My proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength. This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola. New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores. With a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half." Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter. A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years  and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days. A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution. We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee. My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs. One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries.  When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job. Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country. We will start making things in America. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Immigration security is national security. Hillary's pledge for "open borders" includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families. A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America  including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas "approved" on the way in. So let me state this as clearly as I can.  If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. All across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country. Kate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before. 90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die. Laura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned. The examples go on and on and on. Under a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end. That includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation. With a victory in November, everything will change. Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You have 16 days to make this all happen  but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan. Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter. It will be a government of, by and for the people. For those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice. I'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation. I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.  You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.  This is a movement like the world has never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most  important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.  We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me. That is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities. Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs. My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First. Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first. I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists  I work for you, and only you. Our campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future. Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change. Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything  she's just made it worse. American politics is caught in a time loop  we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses. The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime. Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new. I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics. And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country. African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights. Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind. 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth are not currently employed. African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22. In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent  and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016. In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year. The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable. The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably. They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn. The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class. Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence. Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent  which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries. One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact "open borders,"  made in secret to a foreign bank  would destroy the African-American middle class. At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. If I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home  meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits. I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement. I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession  through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need. We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans. Then there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration. I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules  not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI  put our national security at grave risk  and not even face so much as a fine. Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable. We will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal  but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them. On immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country. Infrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary. I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities. School choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education. Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church. This is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people. But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades. The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache. The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering  imagine if that money had been spent at home. My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III. Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system  premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever. Now is the time to embrace a New Direction. I've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country. I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade. Enough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach. Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path  we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible. I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone. I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again. Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people. And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.
Wow, tremendous. Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unbelievable. People don't know, I worked in Ohio, did you know that? [applause] And I had a great experience. [applause] And if I didn't have a great experience starting out when I was very young, maybe I wouldn't be here right now, who knows? You need that, it was great for confidence also. In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio [applause] And we are going to win back the White House. [applause] A brand new poll from Remington Research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up. [applause] Early voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don't wanna we don't wanna give this away. AUDIENCE: No! You know, we have a movement going on like they've never seen before in this country. Drain the swamps, you've gotta a "drain the swamp" sign back there, we're going to drain the swamp, believe me. [applause] But this is a movement like they've never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we're going to turn our country around, we're going to turn it around fast. [applause] Seventy-five percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction. We know it's headed in the wrong direction. We're going to fix it, we're going to take our country back, and it's going to be put very quickly on the right track. [applause] Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause] It's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare, you see that. [booing] Including premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116 percent. Don't worry, you'll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you're not going to have to worry about it. [applause] Even Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, "The craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half."  Job killing [applause] Job killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. Remember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare? [booing] He said they could pass Obamacare when he didn't know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place. [booing] The only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people. And it was very, very sad. And in all fairness to the Democrats, had our President not lied 28 times remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much they would not have gone for it. But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him.  They've caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks. Hillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down [applause] Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse. So, here, I'm going to repeal it, replace it. We're going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better. You don't even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it's just Look, it is so it is so out of control, you'll never get to use it. Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county. It's a total disaster. [booing] Here in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks. That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon. Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it's a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth. [applause] Have to win. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C. [applause] Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls, I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer. Right? Wrong, wrong. Let's get rid of these And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times.  The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about. Just found that out yesterday. WikiLeaks. The more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lies between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances, they all get blurred.  Just today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand, bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts. Mr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt. In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.  If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office. And we've had enough. Honestly, I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness. Right? Don't you agree? [applause] Had enough. I mean at what point, at what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency. [applause] I propose a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say. If we win on November eighth, when [applause] OK, OK. When we win on November eighth. [applause] We don't want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say. The media now, they're going wild. The media's going wild. Because they're saying, you know, this guy's winning in Florida, he's winning in North Carolina, he's winning in Iowa, he's winning in Ohio. All right. When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause] A lot of spirit in this room it's a good one. That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. At the core of my contract is my economic plan. That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room jobs, jobs, jobs.  No, it's terrible what's happened, what's happened in this area, what's happened in this country with jobs is terrible. Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate. Instead the jobs left. They didn't come in, they left. She been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything. She's just made things worse, except for herself and her husband.  Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million Americans live in poverty. Nearly one in four Americans, in their prime earning years, are not working or able to work. Seventy million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of six are living in abject poverty Our national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling, bad shape. Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Think of it. And that's so true. The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.  What our politicians have allowed to happen to this area, but to all areas of our country. NAFTA, TPP they want to approve. A disaster. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton. Remember, every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons. It was NAFTA. It was caused by the Clintons. Why a deal like that was allowed.  We've lost 70,000 factories. Think of that one, 70. I tell everybody, it's a typo. Can't be 70,000. It is. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. Just this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers, and moved their jobs to Mexico. And you've had many. I could I could name them all day long.  Under my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products. [applause] And folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you're not losing your companies anymore. And if you do, at least the country's gonna make a lot of money. OK? We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want - right now it's a one-way highway. We lose our jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. We lose our cash. They get the cash, they get the jobs, they get the companies. We get the drugs, we get the unemployment. That's what we get. We get nothing. We get less than nothing.  We will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we can't renegotiate it properly. We're gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies. Because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people. We can't. We can't. [applause] As part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent. We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans. We will be a rich nation once again. [applause] But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, you know that story. And spreading violently, it's spreading now into the United States. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East, or what they call the Nation of the Cross. OK. The Nation of the Cross.  They are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims. This is something that we would read about in history books. And not since medieval times, right? Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening. So we have no choice. We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast. [applause] And unlike what they've done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we're not giving three and four months notice. We're coming in. We're coming in. You think General George Patton would say, "We're coming in in three or four months, get ready"? What a bunch. They're throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks. They're hanging their victims from meat hooks. The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.  Now Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking. [booing] We don't want ISIS in our country. The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores. I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people. SO important. [applause] Keeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States. A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions. And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. That was easy. [applause] We're not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people. No longer. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] Hillary also said she wants totally open borders. [booing] No one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States. Totally open borders. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. [applause] Have to. We have to. Audience: Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. And who is going to pay for the wall? [applause] One hundred percent. Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United States. Their leaders are doing a much smarter job. But you know what? We'll be happy with Mexico. Mexico's gonna be wonderful, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China and with other - we don't even have good relationships now. They rip us off and we still don't get along. At least they should be nice to us. They're not even nice. They'll be nice.  Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Right here in Ohio. Sixty-year old Margaret Costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, "Please, please don't let him out. Please take him in."  Then there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home. Earl's body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape. A blunt force injury to his head. His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. [booing] But others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, "Don't let them out. Don't let them into our society." I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members. When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end. [applause] We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military. Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it's ever been. Did you know that? Because I know what you have here. You guys are good with Wright Patterson. Right? What a great place. But we're very depleted, we have old equipment. We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at 'em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. We have a lot of veterans here today.  I want to thank them for their service and let them know as president I have your back. Believe me. [applause] I have your back. We will. She just said, "Make America great again, Mr. Trump." We will make America great again. Don't worry about it. We will. And it won't take too long. We will change our foreign policy. Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil. We're spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair. Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power - Russia - which could very well lead to World War III.  And the way she talks about Putin. She's always said she has no idea, but she's always saying Wikileak, it's Russia, and Donald Trump I have nothing to do with Russia.  She said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer's no, no. But what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia. Look, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say and she uses it to keep trying to get votes.  I said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along? Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries? [applause] And we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause] Because they want to get them out also. [applause] But she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don't think that's smart, you know. You can be very tough, but you shouldn't be doing what she's doing. As her own team has said in Wikileaks, she has terrible instincts. To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership, it really is time. [applause] It really is. [applause] Can you imagine four more years of Obama? That's what you got to [booing] It's high taxes, it's high regulations, all these companies they can't even breathe with the regulations, unnecessary. It's ISIS all over the place. You know, she says she'll stop ISIS. Let me tell you, there was no ISIS. There was no ISIS. During her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq, ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right?  Well they're not the JV anymore, folks. They're going to be no trouble, we are going to knock them so hard. But look, look, they're not the JV, and they weren't them. And now they're in 32 different countries. So she's saying we will get rid of ISIS. She wants to go back home and go to sleep, that's what she wants to do. [applause] Did you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job? We built the building by the way, under budget, and ahead of schedule. [applause] And she said Donald Trump got off the campaign trail. I mean I've been doing six, seven, eight things a day every single day. She's home sleeping half the time. [applause] I say she's definitely a low energy person. I said where is Hillary? I watched after the last debate, and after the second debate. She was tired, wow. [applause] She walked off that stage, she had a lot of people around, they had a lot of people around her, which was smart. Everything will change in November. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. [applause] We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. [applause] We're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. [applause] We're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our vets. [applause] We will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We are going to save our second amendment which is under siege. [applause] And we'll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] Americans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. It's like our politics are caught in time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again, Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton, the impeachment, the lying, the whole thing.  We're going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that, and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses. These career politicians keep telling us that things can't change, that we can't find new solutions. That's basically what they tell us.  Well I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics, and not the critics. The future belongs to the dreamers. [applause] I'm asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. I'm going to fight for every American, of every background, in every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty, and crime and fear.  And I'm going to fight for the inner cities, and for the African- American community, and the way they're forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety. [applause] I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special [applause] I'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause] That's right, once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause] You gotta get out and vote. It's going to be something special. And I tell you this, and I tell others this sometimes, this is amazing group of people, the spirit, the energy, the genius, the genius. But you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life, but most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you've ever cast. [applause] Because our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win with trade, we don't win with our great military, we don't allow them to win, we don't win with ISIS  The world is laughing at us. We don't win at the borders. We don't win with taking care of our vets. We don't win with anything. We don't win anymore. We will start winning again like you've never seen before. [applause] And I kiddingly say that one of our great two congressmen that are here someplace where are those great guys? They're here. They're going to be coming to see me at the White House, and they're going to say Mr. President, Mr. President sir, Mr. President [applause] The people of Ohio, they can't take it anymore, sir. You're winning too much. You knocked out ISIS, there are too many jobs in Ohio, too many companies are pouring in. We have a little traffic. Traffic wouldn't be a bad thing [applause] We are going to win like never before. [applause] We are going to make our country wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.  Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. [applause] Make sure you go out and vote. God bless you. God bless you. [applause]
Thank you. [applause]  Thank you very much. [applause] We love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. [applause] I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. [applause] The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation  Audience: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! And they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. [applause] Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. [applause]  This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. [applause] So that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. [applause]  With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK? [applause]  I want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General. Thank you very much. Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, "General get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here." Thank you General.  In 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire [applause] the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. [applause] Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare [applause]  We can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track. It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration. It has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.  In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare [booing] admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we? We're catching all of these people. We're doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there's another. See, we didn't forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.  I said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election. We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.  But the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? [applause]  The FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. [applause] And they're going to save their reputation by doing so. Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. [applause] Just this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country. Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong. Do they do anything right? We don't win anymore. We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17. We're going to start winning again. We're going to start winning again. [applause]  Because it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof. You don't get to use it. We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We'll never have another chance.  And by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th. [applause]  But real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened. Wow. We have a big day. [applause] No think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate [applause]  Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. That to me because it was so simple, you know? Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia. Then she talks to me about Russia. 20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.  But you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI [booing] and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think. Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud. [applause]  Just yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.  This man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. [booing]  The same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time. [booing] And these people are seriously corrupt. [booing] Terribly conflict. Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts. Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign.  And by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1. And if you look at Florida, we're winning. Ohio, we're winning. Iowa we're winning. [applause] Doing great in New Hampshire. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. [applause] We better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. OK, we will. [applause] In fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big. I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire. Believe me, I don't have the courage. [applause]  I'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will. You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody. I said that's like that's a lot of dinners. They don't expect that.  But you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. [applause]  And I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn't fit.  But I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem? And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that. But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine. I'd say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent [applause] And I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far.  Anyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton. $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.  And you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. But there's something nice about that. Unless I lose, in which case I say, "What was that all about?" But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest. [applause]  Hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression. If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]  At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You've been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent. If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe. Last quarter we were at 1 percent. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic, that was the word they used. Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.  And they say it's hard because we're a large county. Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent. China is at 7 percent. And China's not happy. So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty.  Meanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, "Who negotiates these contracts?" We're living through Obama. It's true. You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They're stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world. New Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster.  The Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. [applause]  And I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage.  So it's complicated. I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We're going to get it done, folks, so easily. [applause]  If a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent. [applause]  So when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals.  Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around. [applause]  But there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border [applause] with their product, you know what they're gonna say? They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay. It's very simple. But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will does anybody know what I mean by that? [applause] We will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [applause] We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country. There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had. Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent [booing] the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. [applause]  And we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt. We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share. We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what? We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know. [applause]  Let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep [applause]  When... [applause]  We love New Hampshire, I love this place. I love this place. By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places. The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don't think so, I don't think so. [applause]  These polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is? These are false. I don't think so. She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd. I don't think so. I think we're winning New Hampshire big. OK. So we'll change it. When I'm elected president [applause] I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. Boy, you people have energy, you're great. [applause] Well, let's face it, it's been a long time, right? It's been a long time. You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy. You know what's happening? A lot of these places A lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. [booing] But people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs. We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.  No, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. I mean, how stupid is this? How stupid?  And I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They've never seen anything like it. And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, "I've never seen we have never seen anything like it." [applause]  People are coming out that haven't voted in years. People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years. So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you. So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven't voted in years.  And people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know. [applause]  Now, who knows who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right? I don't think so. [booing] History has taught us that we don't think so. So, I think we're doing great. And yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. [applause] Got to stop the drugs. Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much. Believe me, they're they're not spoken about.  And how about where they're shooting? During fires, they're shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They're shooting at firemen. They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again. We're going to bring it like this room. [applause]  Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it.  The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large. Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they're incredible. Also among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent. And he shot Grant through the head.  Another victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. [booing] And this person was deported five previous times. And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother.  Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen.  In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. This is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.  When I'm president, believe me, it will end. [applause] Not only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance [applause]  And by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. [applause]  So as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. [applause]  You will be so proud. I just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped. We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before. Every every crowd, every auditorium.  The other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in? We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in? And they said, we can't. I said, but there's no fire, we're outside. He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede.  And it's a stampede of love. It's true. It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love. [applause] Because there was so many people. They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward. So I fully understood it. But we have something going on that's so special. It's so special. We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes. We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country. [applause]  We're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people. We call them the forgotten men and women. Greatly simplify your returns. The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R Block, they will not like us. They're not gonna like Trump too much. But we'll greatly simplify your taxes. And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent. [applause]  We're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing.  We are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We're gonna have people come into our country. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in. [applause]  And they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally. And we're gonna streamline the process. People are waiting on line now 10 years. We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally. And we want merit, too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don't hear anymore. A word you don't hear any more. It's too bad.  We're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court [applause] Who you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. [applause]  We're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. [applause]  Our military is depleted. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength. [applause] And hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this. We're getting rid of ISIS. We're getting rid of ISIS. [applause] ISIS is we have no choice. By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since not since medieval times. It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.  ISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back. And it would have been nice the element of surprise. Do we agree? Does anybody not agree? [applause]  The element of surprise. We don't use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.  But we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again. We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of. [applause] I will work so hard for every community. I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I'll be working hard for every community. And we're gonna have this divided nation come together. And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again. [applause]  But we are going to make America great again. [applause] And I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You're very special people. You're very, very special people. God bless you, get out and vote. [applause] Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. [applause]
Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington. As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton. This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered. Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful. Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure. She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. To further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing. She even pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified. As the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit. The Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in. The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before  including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street. Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. Hillary should have been convicted long ago. That the legal process has been taking this long is incredible. And now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI  that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her. 97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton. There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona. He said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees. This is what we mean when we call it a rigged system. Now the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right  but what should have been done many months ago. Perhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach. The stakes on November 8th could not be higher. A vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system. What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws  Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle. Public Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy. Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself. If the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government. It deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation. Corruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system. When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They detach. Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged. When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority. Hillary believes money and power  not truth and justice  should rule the day. As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob. This is what we often see in Third World countries  where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment. Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped. Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President. We must save the America. That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.
The silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House. A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE. Every single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible. Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half." In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said "the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable." Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the "stupidity of the American voter." Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington. As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton. This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered. Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful. Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure  and exposure. She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. But she didn't care  as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter. To cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear  some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing. The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government. Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators  whoever offers the highest price. Yet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI  that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton. 97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton. There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona. This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged. A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself. What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws  Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded. Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government. When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope  they stop dreaming, they stop trying. When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future. Hillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped. As FDR once said, "government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob." Hillary believes money and power  not truth and justice  should rule the day. We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives. Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again. Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President. Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law. Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched. Look at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails. This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough. This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future. My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty. America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country. Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors. Her policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression. A Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars. My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas. We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. We have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement. When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back. These were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime. Hillary has pledged "open borders," and supports Sanctuary Cities. Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job. These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported  but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother. 28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. 33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head. 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant. His illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free. When I become President, this crime wave ends. We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities. We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation. We will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients. Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need  fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base. Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence  that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center. Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft  they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore. We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First. Hillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East. Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days  We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing  she's just made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future. With your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. Together, We Will Make America JUST Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
In 8 days, we are going to win the Great State of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House. Let me start today by making a very important promise. When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again. The political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled. I will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job. Because, when we win, it's going to be America First. So you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th. You have to vote. Vote with all of your heart and soul. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people. I'm asking you to believe in America once again. But to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. It's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes. In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said "the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable." Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive  in fact, much more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan. Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails  just one more lie out of so many. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department  and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat. Hillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating. Hillary is not the victim  the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it. Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. He wrote an article entitled "I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary." Schoen writes: "I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election." Schoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation  and probably a trial of a sitting President. The investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer. She is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford. We need to be going to work for the American people  we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution. Hillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions. The Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People. My Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs. Michigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs. So when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember: Hillary Clinton did much of this to you. Hillary got rich selling your jobs  the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor. Just look at the devastation. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi. They got a raw deal, and they deserve better. GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton. Lear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea. FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico. Chrysler laid off over 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries. Ford laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to other countries. Now, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico. A Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs. If Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone  I will call the executives  and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border. It used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint. We are going to turn it all around. We are going to rebuild Flint. We are going to rebuild Detroit. And we are going to rebuild Michigan. I'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons. Look at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world  now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools. Yet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees. I've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America. That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit. It includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children. My plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations  a number Hillary wants to increase  and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint. My plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime  every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States. Hillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty. The time has come for real change  I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success. Hillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class. We will unleash American energy  including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs. We will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become a rich country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan. When we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program  and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. We've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been  it's a national emergency. They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the "the most radical proposal in U.S. history." When I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First. Hillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied  she blamed it all on a video. Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan. Now, Hillary  trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past  wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III. The arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results. How can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server? It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another. To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days  We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Hillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country. I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day  when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done  the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics. Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing  she's just made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters. We are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice  not money and power  should rule the day. We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people  not the donors and special interests. We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who hope and pray and yearn for a better future. With your vote, we are just 8 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you very much. Thank you. [applause] I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. [applause] And I love you, too. [applause] We have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign. So I really do thank all of you. [applause] I would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done. And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care...[applause] I'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson. [applause] Not only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced. People don't know how well he did during those primaries. And I just kept looking back. And I just kept seeing him. And boy, I'll tell you.  But even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. [applause] Thank you. I'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. [applause] And let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. [applause] And been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator. When we win on November 8th...[applause]...and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. [applause] I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  Which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it.  The Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. [applause] That means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it.  People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.  One-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.  It's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. [applause] Thank you. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost. We've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. [applause] While this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. [applause] We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole Our jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.  A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. [applause] We'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. [applause] And stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. [applause] We are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. [applause] We're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. [applause] We will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. [applause] We're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt. [applause] Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. [applause] We're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. [applause] That means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. [applause] We will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. [applause] People do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you. [laughter] And our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local. Our tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. [applause] We will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. [applause] We will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. [applause] Thank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. [applause] It's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. [applause] Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. [applause] With a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. [applause] To recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Vocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. [applause] And I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. [applause] And just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. [applause] We will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this. [applause] Thank you very much. [applause] The guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. [laughter] I feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... [applause] I'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. [applause] Thank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. [applause] And I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. [applause] The spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now.  But to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it. [applause] Think of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost. And we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.  It's time for new leadership. [applause] I've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. [applause] All I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. [applause] If we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. [applause] I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. [applause] That is how we will truly make America great again. [applause] Thank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you. [applause]
Thank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds. [applause] These crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it.  That I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. [applause] But we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.  And now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. [applause] It's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. [applause] There are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. [applause] I had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze [applause] So they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks [applause] I've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country[applause] Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born—and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it.  We have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. [applause] And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.  We're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places.  We just got a poll with three up in Virginia. [applause] But we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important [applause] And I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. [applause] A disaster. [applause] It is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. [booing] I will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it.  In the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. [booing] Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. [applause] I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving.  In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.  Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. [booing] I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. [applause] Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. [applause] As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. [applause] Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.  What she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.  Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. [booing] Unbelievable. [booing] And as you know, they just found—listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. [booing] And I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're—I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine.  In fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?  You know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. [booing] Instead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really—that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater.  And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. [applause] But that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never—the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. [booing] If you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got—can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. [applause] You know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No. It'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines. I bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers. But she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry? Now, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged. I've been saying it for a—it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. [applause] So corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what? In four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work. In four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.  I mean before you go into phase two—let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.  That's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.  Who knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything. No, no. How do you work? How do you do it? 650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day. But they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.  Out today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.  You saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? [booing] She shouldn't be allowed to run. By the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon. Stand up Johnny. [applause] Now, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much. Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great. But Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends—I'll tell you what. We are going to end—we have no choice.  We really have no choice—government corruption. It's going to end. [applause] I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause] At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. [booing] America has lost—this is so hard to believe—70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it And you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know—I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are—it is being stolen from us folks.  It is—we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. [applause] America first. [applause] It's going to be America first. [applause] A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing—or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.  We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.  I met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.  It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. [booing] Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.  When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. [applause] And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. [applause] Got to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.  And believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.  We don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany—which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause] And yes, we will build a great wall. [applause] We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.  As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back. We bring them to their countries—murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.  I guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. [applause] Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle—incredible young woman—was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.  A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens—the ones we just spoke about—and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. [applause] That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200—more than that now, much more than that—top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.  Great people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before.  The Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's—it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity—real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?  You know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. [applause] With very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. [booing] Why is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. [applause] I'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs.  Now, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess.  To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. [applause] Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause] Thank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there. Anybody want to go swimming? Let's go. [applause] We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.  We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause] We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years.  We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. [applause] We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] We will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream—no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians—they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action.  I have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good. I'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. [booing] These are the most—they—the media—the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the—and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening.  But you know what? You hear—when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. [applause] But they never show it. They never show it. [applause] They never show it. People of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. [applause] We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks "Texas is in play"; "Texas—that Georgia is in play." And I'm saying, "Gee, that's too bad."  Let me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. [applause] And they know it. [applause] But when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think—give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. [applause] And I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. [applause] We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. [applause] We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. [applause] I am asking you to dream big—I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just—can you believe this?—six days away. Think of that. [applause] From the change you've been waiting for your entire life. [applause] We're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote. Thank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, "You're going to win." We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. [applause] We have great, great love. You know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect.  Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. [applause] We will make America safe again. [applause] And we will make America great again. [applause] Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. [applause] Thank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. [applause]
Thank you. Thank you. [applause] I love that sign, "Blacks for Trump." I love that sign, thank you. [applause] There are a lot of those signs. Thank you. "Women for Trump." [applause] "Hispanics for Trump." [applause] There's one "Women and Hispanics for Trump." [applause] Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. [applause] We're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you.  The system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it. There's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the—and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig [booing] is a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail.  Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail—through WikiLeaks again—we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that [booing] right? And that Kadzik said quote "It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails." Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. [booing] Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. [booing] The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department—there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history—is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get—we don't want to blow this.  This is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen—it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. [applause] Got to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause] And Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida—sorry to tell you this, folks—are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. [booing] Now, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona—which I just left—premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control.  Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.  Obamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. [applause] Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has—did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. [applause] They're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing] Crooked Hillary, she's crooked. [booing] Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! She is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her—has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? [applause] That's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time.  She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. [booing] And I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here? These are great people, great, thank you. Hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. [booing] And she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. [booing] She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile [booing] and then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she—rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening—she used them against Bernie Sanders.  Can you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. [applause] Did you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. [applause] Hillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. [applause] We're doing great with the Hispanic community. [applause] And the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. [applause] OK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. [applause] I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. [applause] Folks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.  If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. [booing] Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. [booing] And this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time—I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time.  But I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails—did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? [booing] So today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails. In another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government—right, this should be another one. Just like swamp—you know the swamp little statement—this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. [booing] This is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause] Gonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. [applause] Another important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. [booing] There has never been dishonesty—there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. [booing] The very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy—think of it—of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. [booing] It's unbelievable. It's un-honest. For instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible—as bad as possible. Parenthetically So sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced—97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary.  This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world.  At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. [applause] Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.  This is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. [applause] We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. [booing] And here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.  We are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. [applause] My second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place. The theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. [applause] Currency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. [applause] And Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. [booing] She lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause] We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations [applause] and use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. [applause] That includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. [applause] We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation [applause] A terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. [applause] Law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. [applause] According to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this.  And what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. [applause] We will restore law order and justice in America—justice. [applause] Thank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa. We will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. [applause] Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. [booing] Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program[applause] and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. [applause] Now, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones.  But we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.  And then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. [applause] And we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. [applause] Let's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails. Thank you. It's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? [applause] They don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. [booing] She's never had a crowd like this in her life. [applause] President Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. [applause] He's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. [applause] But we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. [applause] But there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. [applause] Thank you. [applause] We've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [applause] They tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. [applause] So, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. [applause] Hillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where[booing] Right? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. [booing] The immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. [booing] Countless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder.  A Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. [applause] And I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs—"Cubans for Trump." Cubans. I love Cubans. [applause] So they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of. What's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. We're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities—we're going to fix the inner cities.  Thank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause] That includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural—all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about.  We will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve[applause] including protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. [applause] You know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS—we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country.  We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East—six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion—we lost lives, the most incredible, great people.  Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided  Hillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back—rather have all those lives. [applause] Love to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win—we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. [applause] To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. [applause] And she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. [booing] We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [applause] Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. [applause] Support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege [applause] and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] Clinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? [booing] I don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants—she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. [applause] I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. [applause] There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. [booing] Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the—right? Is that right?  We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. [applause] We're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. [booing] We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.  With your vote, we are just—think of it—six days away. [applause] This started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again.  There's never been a movement like this in the history of our country—there's never been a movement like this. Thank you. Thank you. There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country—it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close—get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now.  Maybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [applause] Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] Get out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]
This is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? [applause] We should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in. First of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... [applause] And we are going to win back the White House. [applause] This election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. [applause] That is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. [applause] They get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. [applause] And these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. [booing] They rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it. It's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. [applause] We're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. [applause] The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country. The corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. [booing] That Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? [applause] But she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it. Don't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...[applause] Clean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal You know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...[booing]...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. [booing] Who cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing] Now, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't.  I wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. [applause] The theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause] Sadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...[booing]...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating. Honestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...[applause]...for much less money. It won't matter. [applause] Premiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. By the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated.  And deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. [booing] I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] People are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in. Did you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. [applause] And we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place.  And you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... [applause] I hear. We're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do.  Then we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered.  Real change also means restoring honesty to our government Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit. I have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it.  Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. [booing] She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...[booing]...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens [booing] She's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. [booing] Don't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. [applause] [booing] So dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. [applause] Women for Trump. [applause] They've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well? Great people. Women for Trump. And now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win. I think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow.  My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. [applause] And folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country.  And I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. [booing] A state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. [booing] She can't campaign. [booing] So Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.  And I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. [booing] I like them. [booing] And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. [applause] It's true. I get far bigger crowds. [applause] Look at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan. By the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.  Ford. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. [applause] No, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? [applause] Plus, plus, plus. [applause] It will be amazing. It will be amazing. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called "drain the swamp." We're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it. I told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy. Then I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.  Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [laughter] Is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? [applause] Are we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.  And by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left.  So the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. [laughter] But you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say "did you hear what Donald Trump said today?" [booing] But honestly -- yes. [booing] Those words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair.  It would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat.  So supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions.  To me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal. It's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. [applause] And by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. [applause] Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor.  North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. [booing] Well think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs. Here's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great.  But two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans. Think of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription.  But two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense. And here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster.  Think of it though. [booing] Think of what 70,000 factories is. So those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving.  A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. [applause] If a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.  We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. [applause] And here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave. Now your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that [booing] Substantially. So one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story. We will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. [applause] We will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. [applause] And we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...[applause]...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot.  Chicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing] So you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. [applause] We are all going to fix it. [applause] We're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential.  We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. [booing] Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. [booing] Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going.  When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...[applause]...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] Have no choice. [applause] We have no choice. AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.  TRUMP: We have no choice. But we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton. The migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it.  Now she stands at the debate, "I will fight ISIS." She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. [laughter] Unbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS. So we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country.  You know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money.  So we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much.  So we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. [applause] A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause] And yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. [applause] One hundred percent. [applause] Mexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico.  And the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing?  You really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks. You're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.  So we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. [booing] We're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. [applause] Right? My women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. [applause] We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. [applause] We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause] There have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. [applause] Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson. And we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us.  So we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...[applause] They make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. [applause] Great people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people.  And new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. [applause] I'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less Text And I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?  I'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense. You got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing "we are going into Mosul?" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying "we are going in, in three months to Mosul." And then we're going in, in two months.  And every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been And I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? [applause] Those numbers. Those numbers. [applause] Oh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. [booing] Starting to look good. But wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.  The leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell. But why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win.  And now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. [applause] I don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. [laughter] They'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. [booing] They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing?  That will change starting tomorrow. [applause] Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [applause] So just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. [applause] Can you imagine having Hillary for four years? [booing] I'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night. I mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right.  So sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause] We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially. We're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. [applause] And Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen. We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause] By the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. [applause] The father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.  We're going to protect religious liberty...[applause]...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. [applause] We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. [applause] We will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment. [applause] And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] This sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.  Coming down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved.  We had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? [applause] He's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him. But we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...[applause] Mike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said "he has not reached the 50 percent mark." I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people.  So we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent. And we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...[booing] But -- no. But for the most part...[booing] No. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election. You know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. [applause] Everyone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this. So you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. [applause] So well done. [applause] That's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.  So here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks.  There has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. [applause] But others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.  Somebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that.  But if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money.  I have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice. And we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. [applause] And usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.  So we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen.  They may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. [applause] Change. So you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. [applause] And we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together.  Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause] Just imagine. I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. [applause] Because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.  God bless you, everybody. [applause] Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. [applause] Thank you, folks. Thank you. [applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. [applause] Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. [applause] Thank you very much. [applause] I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. [applause] She congratulated us — it's about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. [applause] I mean that very sincerely. [applause] Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. [applause] It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. [applause] For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people...[laughter]...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. [applause] As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. [applause] It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. [applause] Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. [applause] Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [applause] We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. [applause] They've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. [applause] We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. [applause] We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. [applause] We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. [applause] Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? [applause] My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. [applause] Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don...[applause]...and Ivanka...[applause]...and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. [applause] This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been — it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. [applause] Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. [applause] Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? [applause] Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? [laughter] Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? [applause] Where is Ben? And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much. General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? [applause] And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people. A very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is...[crosstalk] That's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, "They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win," because you can't be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont. But I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. [applause] Boy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. [applause] Say a few words. No, come on, say something. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. [applause] Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God. The President-elect: We will do a great job. [applause] I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... [applause]...you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can...[crosstalk] Thank you very much. And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. [applause] We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause] Thank you to Mike Pence. Thank you. [applause]
